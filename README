This is a service that runs on a Raspberry Pi zero. It manages phone pairing and audio
streaming via Bluetooth. There is a voice feedback interface via pre recorded files
in ogg format. The service does audio mixing and sample rate conversion to 44.1kHz output.

The code is designed to run with a companion Raspberry Pi HAT device tha communicates
with the car's D2B bus and sends control commands to the service.
